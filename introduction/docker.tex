\subsection{Docker}
\marginnote{Source?}\docker{} is a software to create and run applications in virtual environments, without the need to setup a complete virtual operating system for each application. Based on Cgroups and namespaces, \docker{} runs applications in a containerized environment.
To create a containerized application, a special markup file, called a Dockerfile has to be written by the programmer. The Dockerfile defines exactly how the applications environment needs to look like.
