\chapter{Introduction}

Natural language is part of everyone's everyday life and is most commonly used to transmit information human-to-human. While most of this interaction takes place orally or written on paper, the digital revolution and the rise of social media increased the amount of digitally stored natural language tremendously. Gantz and Reinsel predicted 2012 that the amount of digital data stored globally will double about every two years until at least the year 2020 \cite{gantz2012digital}.

Many opportunities arise from this amount of digital data, specifically in the field of machine learning. In 2011, IBM's \qa{} system ``Watson'' famously outmatched professional players in the quiz show ``Jeopardy!'' \cite{ferrucci2012introduction,epstein2012making}. Kudesia et al. proposed 2012 an algorithm to detect so called \cautis{}, common hospital-acquired infections, by utilizing a \nlp{} analysis on the medical records of patients \cite{kudesia2012natural}.
