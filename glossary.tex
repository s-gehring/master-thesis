\newacr{nlp}{NLP}{Natural Language Processing}{Natural-language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language data. Challenges in natural-language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.}
\newcommand{\nlp}{\gls{acr:nlp}}

\newacr{uima}{UIMA}{Unstructured Information Management Applications}{UIMA are software systems that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or located-at.}
\newcommand{\uima}{\gls{acr:uima}}

\newacr{qa}{QA}{Question Answering}{Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and \nlp{}, which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.}
\newcommand{\qa}{\gls{acr:qa}}

\newacr{dkpro}{DKPro}{Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository}{A collection of software components for natural language processing (NLP) based on the Apache UIMA framework.}
\newcommand{\dkpro}{\gls{acr:dkpro}}

\newacr{cauti}{CAUTI}{Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection}{A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection involving any part of the urinary system, including urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidney. UTIs are the most common type of healthcare-associated infection reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75\% are associated with a urinary catheter, which is a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine.  Between 15-25\% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay.  The most important risk factor for developing a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is prolonged use of the urinary catheter.  Therefore, catheters should only be used for appropriate indications and should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.}

\newacr{cpe}{CPE}{Collection Processing Engine}{\uima provides additional support for applying analysis engines to collections of unstructured data with its Collection Processing Architecture. The Collection Processing Architecture defines additional components for reading raw data formats from data collections, preparing the data for processing by Analysis Engines, executing the analysis, extracting analysis results, and deploying the overall flow in a variety of local and distributed configurations.}
\newcommand{\cpe}{\gls{acr:cpe}}

\newacr{uimaas}{UIMA-AS}{UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout}{UIMA-AS is the next generation scalability replacement for the Collection Processing Manager (CPM). UIMA-AS provides more flexible and powerful scaleout capability, and extends support to the UIMA-AS components not supported by the CPM, the flow controller and CAS multiplier.}
\newcommand{\uimaas}{\gls{acr:uimaas}}

\newglossaryentry{glos:docker}{name={Docker},description={Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. It is developed by Docker, Inc. Docker is primarily developed for Linux, where it uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).}}

\newglossaryentry{glos:spark}{name={Apache Spark},description={Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.}}

\newglossaryentry{glos:kafka}{name={Apache Kafka},description={Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.}}
