\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:summary}
The following chapter concludes the thesis by summarizing its results and the frameworks limitations. Furthermore, an outlook on the frameworks source code availability and possible future changes will be given.

\section{Limitations}
TBD.

\section{Conclusion}

TBD.


\section{Availability}
\label{sec:availability}
From November 2018 on, the frameworks code will be publicized on GitHub\footnote{On \url{https://github.com/s-gehring/master-thesis-program}}. Since the framework is wrapped inside a maven project, it will also be uploaded to the central maven repository. Furthermore, another git repository that contains a working \spark{} dockerfile and the evaluation setup architecture will be published\footnote{On \url{https://github.com/s-gehring/master-thesis-spark}}. Next, the maven project that defines the benchmarking Java code will be available\footnote{On \url{https://github.com/s-gehring/master-thesis-benchmark}}. A hybrid project that consists of the deployment of \uimaas{} used in the evaluation and defines a dockerfile containing a working \uimaas{} installation will also be published on GitHub\footnote{On \url{https://github.com/s-gehring/master-thesis-uimaas}}. At last, this Thesis and the corresponding \LaTeX{} code will be available on GitHub as well \footnote{On \url{https://github.com/s-gehring/master-thesis}}.

All repositories will be published under the MIT license and are therefore free to use.

\section{Outlook}
First, the framework and all evaluation related code and resources will be made public according to Section~\ref{sec:availability}. Other than that further improvements to the presented framework can still be made. The wrapping class \lstinline|AnalysisResult| only provides a subset of its underlying \lstinline|JavaRDD| functionality. The other functions were not needed at the time of writing and have therefore been neglected. However, an unwrapping of said \rdd{} may be desired, making further processing of the underlying \cas{} possible. In such a way, one could benefit substantially more from \spark{}s optimization features.

Furthermore, more compression algorithms may be implemented in the future, making compression for different serializations feasible. New serialization techniques, like delta \cas{} as used in \cite{epstein2012making} could also help improve the frameworks performance.

Apache released \uima{} 3.0.0 on March 2018, which is supposed to be mostly backwards compatible to \uima{} 2.10.2, for which the framework was written. Although \uima{} 2.10.2 will still be supported and maintained, an upgrade to \uima{} 3.0.0 also seems like a possibility for improvement.
